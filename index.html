                <p class="justify">Hi there! I’m <b>Hugo</b> (a.k.a. <i><b>simoH</b></i>), an eager <b>game developer</b> based in <b>Portugal</b>, looking to expand my capabilities and provide <b>memorable experiences filled with choices, emotions, and fun</b>. I'm currently studying Multimedia and Communication Technologies at the University of Aveiro, where I’ve obtained most of my experience, being involved in projects like <b>2D and 3D game and animations</b>, some shown below, using <b>Unity, Blender, Photoshop</b>, and other software.<br><br>My focus areas include <b>gameplay and level design and programming</b>, while growing an interest and dabbling in <b>narrative design</b>, it being what made me fall in love with videogames in the first place with pieces like Telltale’s The Walking Dead, Resident Evil 4 or The Last of Us and their gameplay features and memorable characters and relationships.<br><br>Before diving into game development, I spent four years studying <b>photography</b>, getting used to the art of imagery and practicing with <b>Lightroom and Photoshop</b>. I still do it to the day as a hobby and it is something that influences my creative process and the way I put my ideas into motion in my projects. Here’s a showcase of my previous photography work. Enjoy!</p>

Developed using the Twine platform.</p>

                        <p class="proj_text">The DigiMedia project attempts to bring students closer to both the university and other students, helping out with their projects. On the third edition of the project, I and three other colleagues were asked to analyze four of the most played and finished videogames of 2018 (mine is <i>Marvel's Spiderman</i>), picking their most intense scenes, reviewing those very same scenes, understand what the community thinks of these games and write an article based on our results. The project is still in development.<p>

We were asked to create a fictional product and brand for an app, design its entire UI and then, prototype it. With that Melodrop was born. An app made for videographers and editors where they can get access and share tracks for their projects.</p>
