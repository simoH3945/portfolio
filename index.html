                <p class="justify">Hey there! I’m <b>Hugo</b> – also known as <i><b>simoH</b></i>) – a curious creator and communicator, attentive to detail, and passionate about <b>writing, storytelling, and deep, interactive experiences</b>. I hold a degree in Multimedia and Communication Technologies and am currently pursuing a Master’s in Digital Game Development, where I’ve gained most of my practical experience. I’ve worked numerous <b>2D and 3D game academic projects</b> – not only crafting <b>narrative and worldbuilding</b>, but also managing and implementing <b>core mechanics and animations</b>. At the same time, I write <b>amateur videogame reviews</b> on platforms like Steam, using them as a space to sharpen my writing and critical thinking, while sharing my personal experiences with fellow players and enthusiasts.<br><br>Before diving into game development, I studied <b>photography</b> for four years - working the art of imagery, and learning how to express <b>emotion and thought</b> through images, and developing a strong visual sensibility that still informs my work and remains a beloved hobby. Below you’ll find a showcase of some of my photography work from that time. Enjoy!<br><br>As mentioned, my main areas of interest are <b>narrative design, world building, and videogames media writing</b> – the elements that made me fall in love with this industry in the first place. From Telltale’s The Walking Dead to The Last of Us, and through the voices of passionate media outlets, I’ve always been drawn to these <b>impactful experiences</b>, and <b>sharing them</b> with the most passionate and loving communities.<br><br>I believe in the power of strong stories and videogames to <b>inspire empathy and bring new perspectives to the surface, leaving long-lasting impressions</b> – and I firmly believe these emotions and experiences are <b>better shared with others</b>. Driven by the desire to create and share defining experiences with fellow enthusiasts, I seek to expand my knowledge and refine my skills as both a creator and a communicator – now in the professional world.</p>
